# Project Backend - Student Club Management System

## Description

This project's backend is a RESTful API that manages student clubs and students, and connects to a MongoDB database. The backend is responsible for handling all data processing and storage, and communicates with the frontend to provide a seamless user experience. Users can interact with the system to create, read, update, and delete information about clubs and students.

## Features

- CRUD operations for clubs and students
- Secure authentication and authorization for users
- Efficient and scalable MongoDB database connection
- Real-time data synchronization between the frontend and backend
